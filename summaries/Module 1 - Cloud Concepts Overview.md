### Section 1 - Introduction to cloud computing
- What is cloud computing?
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computer power database, storage, applications and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Types of cloud computing.
	- __Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)__, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computes and data storage space.
	- __Platform As A Service (PaaS),__ removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
	- __Software As A Service (SaaS),__ provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
- Cloud computing deployment models.
	- __Cloud,__ a cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud.
	- __Hybrid,__ hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud.
	- __On-premises,__ the deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called the "private cloud".
### Section 2 - Advantage of cloud computing
- __Six advantages of cloud computing.__
	- Trade capital expense for variable expense.
	- Benefit from massive economies of scales.
	- Stop guessing capacity.
	- Increase speed and agility.
	- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
	- Go global in minutes.
### Section 3 - Introduction to AWS
- What are web services?
	A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format for the request and the response of and application programming interface (API) interaction.
	AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products.
- Choosing a service.
	The service you select depends on your business goals and technology requirements.
	- __Amazon EC2,__ you want complete control over your AWS computing resources.
	- __AWS Lambda,__ you want to run your code and not manage or provision servers.
	- __AWS Elastic Beanstalk,__ you want a service that deploys, manages and scales your web applications for you.
	- __Amazon Lightsail,__ you need a lightweight cloud platform for a simple web application.
	- __AWS Batch,__ you need to run hundreds of thousands of batch workloads.
	- __AWS Outposts,__ you want to run AWS infrastructure in your on-premises data center.
	- __Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).__
	- __Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).__
	- __AWS Fargate,__ you want to implement a containers or microservices architecture.
	- __VMware Cloud on AWS,__ you have an on-premises server virtualization platform that you want to migrate to AWS.
	There are more at [[AWS Services]]
	Three ways to interact with AWS:
	- AWS Management Console (Interface).
	- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).
	- Software Development Kits (SDKs).
### Section 4 - Moving to the AWS Cloud - The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF).
Cloud adoption is not instantaneous for most organizations and requires a thoughtful, deliberate strategy and alignment across the whole organization.
AWS CAF was created to help organizations develop efficient and effective plans for their cloud adoption journey. CAF organice guidance into six areas of focus, called perspective:
- __Business perspective,__ stakeholder from the business perspective can use the AWS CAF to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritise cloud adoption initiatives.
- __People perspective,__ stakeholders from the people perspective can use the AWS CAF to evaluate organisational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements and identify gaps.
- __Governance perspective,__ stakeholder from the governance perspective can use the AWS CAF to focus on the skills and processes that are needed to align IT strategy and goals with business strategy and goals.
- __Platform perspective,__ stakeholder from platform perspective use a variety of architectural dimensions and models to understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships.
- __Security perspective,__ stakeholder from the security perspective must ensure that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control and agility.
- __Operations perspective,__ stakeholder from the operations perspective define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year business is conducted.
